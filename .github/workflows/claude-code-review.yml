            This is a newly opened pull request. Please conduct a comprehensive review of all changes.' || '## INCREMENTAL REVIEW - New Commits Only

            New commits were pushed to this PR. Focus your review ONLY on the incremental changes.

            IMPORTANT: First check for previous review comments using `gh pr view ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --comments`.

            ## Review Guidelines

            Please review for:
            - Code quality and best practices
            - Potential bugs or issues
            - Performance considerations
            - Security concerns
            - Test coverage

            Use the repository's CLAUDE.md for guidance on style and conventions.

            ## How to Leave Comments

            You have two options:

            ### Option 1: Inline Review Comments (Preferred)
            Use `gh api` to create inline comments on specific lines:

            ```bash
            gh api repos/${{ github.repository }}/pulls/${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}/reviews \
              -f event=COMMENT \
              -f body="Overall review summary" \
              -f 'comments[][path]=path/to/file.go' \
              -f 'comments[][line]=42' \
              -f 'comments[][body]=Specific feedback for this line'
            ```

            ### Option 2: General PR Comment
            Use `gh pr comment ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} -b "Your review"` for general feedback.

            Choose inline comments when you can point to specific lines. Use general comments for architectural or high-level feedback.
