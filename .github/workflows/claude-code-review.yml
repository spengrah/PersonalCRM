            IMPORTANT: First check for previous review comments using `gh pr view ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --comments`. If you previously left a review, reference it in your new comment (e.g., "Following up on my previous review..." or "Addressing the changes since my last review...")' }}

            ## Review Philosophy: STRICT MODE

            **"If Claude Code can fix it, don't merge it."**

            Since implementation cost is low with Claude Code, maintain a HIGH bar for approval.
            Request changes for anything that could be improved.

            ## Approval Criteria (ALL must be true)

            AUTO-APPROVE only if the code meets ALL of these criteria:
            ✓ No security concerns (SQL injection, XSS, auth issues, secrets, etc.)
            ✓ No bugs or unhandled edge cases
            ✓ Comprehensive test coverage for new/changed code
            ✓ Clear, well-documented code (comments where needed)
            ✓ Follows repository conventions (check @.ai/rules.md, @CLAUDE.md)
            ✓ Proper error handling and validation
            ✓ Good performance (no obvious inefficiencies)
            ✓ No TODOs or technical debt introduced
            ✓ No code style inconsistencies

            ## Request Changes (DEFAULT)

            REQUEST CHANGES if ANY of these apply:
            - Security concerns (even potential/minor ones)
            - Bugs, race conditions, or edge cases not handled
            - Missing or insufficient tests
            - Unclear code needing comments/documentation
            - Doesn't follow repo conventions or best practices
            - Performance concerns or inefficiencies
            - Poor/missing error handling or validation
            - Code style inconsistencies
            - Opportunities for refactoring
            - TODOs or unfinished work
            - Missing documentation

            Use the repository's CLAUDE.md and .ai/rules.md for guidance on conventions.

            ## How to Submit Review

            After reviewing, you MUST submit an actual GitHub review (not just a comment):

            ### If Code is Excellent (rare):
            ```bash
            gh pr review ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --approve -b "✅ LGTM - Code meets all quality criteria:
            - Security: No concerns
            - Tests: Comprehensive coverage
            - Documentation: Clear and complete
            - Performance: Efficient implementation
            - Conventions: Follows repo standards"
            ```

            ### If Any Issues Found (default):
            ```bash
            gh pr review ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --request-changes -b "Found issues that should be addressed:

            **Security:**
            - [List any security concerns]

            **Code Quality:**
            - [List bugs, edge cases, refactoring needs]

            **Testing:**
            - [List missing or insufficient tests]

            **Documentation:**
            - [List unclear code or missing docs]

            **Performance:**
            - [List inefficiencies]

            **Style/Conventions:**
            - [List style issues or convention violations]

            Since these can be quickly fixed with Claude Code, please address before merging."
            ```

            IMPORTANT: You can also add inline comments using gh api for specific line-by-line feedback, but you MUST also submit a final review with --approve or --request-changes.
