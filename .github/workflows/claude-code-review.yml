            This is a newly opened pull request. Please conduct a comprehensive review of all changes.' || '## INCREMENTAL REVIEW - New Commits Only

            New commits were pushed to this PR. Focus your review ONLY on the incremental changes.

            Use `git diff ${{ github.event.before }}..${{ github.event.after }}` to see what changed in this push.

            IMPORTANT: First check for previous review comments using `gh pr view ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --comments`. If you previously left a review, reference it in your new comment (e.g., "Following up on my previous review..." or "Addressing the changes since my last review...")' }}

            ## Review Standards

            Follow the strict code review standards in @.ai/reviewers.md

            This file contains:
            - Review philosophy: "If Claude Code can fix it, don't merge it"
            - Approval criteria (ALL must be true for approval)
            - Request changes criteria (ANY applies = request changes)
            - References to @.ai/rules.md for repository conventions

            ## How to Submit Review

            After reviewing, you MUST submit exactly ONE GitHub review using `gh pr review`.

            CRITICAL: Do NOT submit multiple reviews or use both `gh api` and `gh pr review`. Submit ONE review only.

            ### If Code is Excellent (rare):
            ```bash
            gh pr review ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --approve -b "✅ LGTM - Code meets all quality criteria:
            - Security: No concerns
            - Tests: Comprehensive coverage
            - Documentation: Clear and complete
            - Performance: Efficient implementation
            - Conventions: Follows repo standards"
            ```

            ### If Any Issues Found (default):
            ```bash
            gh pr review ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --request-changes -b "Found issues that should be addressed:

            **Security:**
            - [List any security concerns]

            **Code Quality:**
            - [List bugs, edge cases, refactoring needs]

            **Testing:**
            - [List missing or insufficient tests]

            **Documentation:**
            - [List unclear code or missing docs]

            **Performance:**
            - [List inefficiencies]

            **Style/Conventions:**
            - [List style issues or convention violations]

            Since these can be quickly fixed with Claude Code, please address before merging."
            ```

            Note: For specific line-by-line feedback, include file paths and line numbers in your review body using markdown formatting. Do not use gh api to create separate inline comments.
